steps:
  - Peal and cut the onion in half and slice into half-rings.
  - Cut the Tofu in 5 - 10mm (1/3 inch) wide slices and saut√© together witch the onion and a bit of oil in a hot pan.
    Season with 2 pinches of salt and 1 pinch of pepper.
  - While the tofu and onion are cooking, we can prepare the sauce. Add 3 Tbsp. vegan mayonnaise, 2 Tbsp. ketchup,
    1 Tbsp. mustard to a small bowl and season with 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 pinch of salt and 1 tsp. smoked paprika.
    Mix and set aside.
  - Slice the tomato and pickles and put them to the side, together with the salad leaves.
  - Once the tofu and onions are getting crispy, we add 50 - 150 g vegan cheese together with a few tsp. of water.
    Cover the pan and let it cook until the cheese is melted.
  - Toast the buns either on a toaster or use a pan with a bit of oil.
  - "When everything is ready, we put the buns on a plate, spread some sauce on both sides and add the toppings in the
    following order:
    Salad, Tofu with Onions and Cheese, Tomato, Pickles. Done."
