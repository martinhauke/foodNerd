steps:
  - Cut the 2 Onions (or one big onion) in rough pieces and saut√© with a bit of oil an a pan.
  - Drain the Tofu and give it a quick squeeze to get rid off excess moisture. After that move the onions in the pan to
      the side to make some room for the Tofu. Put the tofu into the hot pan and let it get crispy on one side.
  - Add the tomatoes into the pan and stir them together with the onions.
  - Spread the 4 Tbsp. of vegan mayonnaise on the tofu.
  - Put the 2 tsp. black salt, 2 Tbsp. nutritional yeast, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. tumeric and 1 tsp. sweet paprika
      into a small bowl and mix everything. Spread the spice mixture on top of the vegan mayonnaise.
  - Once the tofu is crispy on one side and the tomatoes are starting to shrivel, we can use a spatula to poke the
      tofu and cut it up into chunks (not too small, a good bite size). Make sure to work the mayonnaise-spice mixture into it.
      Mix everything in the pan and let it fry some more.
  - Serve as is or put it on a slice of bread, together with some arugula and vegan cheese.
