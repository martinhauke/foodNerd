steps:
  - Add 1 cup of rice and 2 cups of water into a pot and bring it to a boil. Keep simmering until the water is gone.
  - Meanwhile peel the onion and cut it into fine cubes. Peel the carrots and cut them into thin slices. Put the onions
    and carrots into a hot pan with a drizzle of oil.
  - Cut the bell pepper and zucchini into bite sized pieces and add them to the pan. Fry everything until it is getting
    some browning.
  - While the vegetables are frying, you can add the vegan créme fraîche, the juice of half a lime and a pinch of salt
    into a small bowl and mix everything. Feel free to add some garlic, if you want.
  - Once the vegetables are done, add 2 tsp. peanut butter and 2 Tbsp. agave syrup. Deglaze with 2 - 3 Tbsp. of soy
    sauce. Stir until you get a thick and consistent sauce.
  - Serve everything on a plate or in a bowl.
