  alt: Roasted Tofu with Tomato Rice and Chickpea-Bean-Dip
steps:
  - We start with the rice. Peel and cut one onion in fine cubes and sauté with 1 Tbsp. oil.
  - After one to two minutes, add 1 Tbsp tomato paste and occasionally stir until you get some browning.
  - Next we add 1 cup of rice, 1 pinch of salt, 1 pinch of pepper and a stalk of celery. Continue frying for a
        bit before deglazing with 2 cups of water. Keep simmering on small heat until the water is gone.
  - While the rice is cooking, we can prepare the tofu. Cut 1 onion in rough pieces and sauté in a pan with oil.
        Rinse the tofu and give it a quick gentle squeeze to remove excess water. Cut the tofu into large cubes
        (about 1cm or 1/3 of an inch) and add it to the onions. Add enough salt (1-2 pinches) and let it fry while
        stirring occasionally.
  - After the tofu got some color, we add 1-2 tsp. of garlic powder, 1-2 tsp smoked paprika and 2 Tbsp. agave
        syrup. Continue frying while stirring until the syrup starts caramelizing. Deglaze with 1 Tbsp. of soy sauce.
  - Keep an eye on the rice and check if it's ready. Take it of the oven, cover it and put it to the side for now.
  - Finally we prepare the dip. Drain the canned chickpeas and beans through a sieve and rinse with water.
        Put all ingredients (chickpeas, black beans, créme fraîche, 1 pinch of salt, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp.
        agave syrup, juice of 1/2 lime) in a bowl and stir until everything is mixed.
  - Plate and enjoy.
